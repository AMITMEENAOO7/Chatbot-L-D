This document provides a detailed understanding of the 360-degree feedback approach, its 
purpose, and its implementation. 
1. What is the 360-Degree Feedback Process? 
The 360-degree feedback process is a comprehensive evaluation method that collects 
feedback about an individual's performance from multiple sources. Unlike traditional 
feedback systems, which rely solely on a supervisor’s perspective, this approach captures 
input from: 
• Peers/Colleagues: Team members or collaborators. 
• Direct Reports: For individuals in managerial or supervisory roles. 
• Managers/Supervisors: The immediate supervisor or manager. 
• Self: An individual’s self-assessment. 
• External Sources: Clients, vendors, or other external partners (if applicable). 
 
2. Why Implement the 360-Degree Feedback Process? 
• Holistic View: Offers a comprehensive picture of an individual’s performance. 
• Self-Awareness: Allows individuals to compare self-assessments with feedback from 
others, highlighting areas for improvement. 
• Continuous Growth: Supports personal and professional development, fostering a 
culture of continuous growth. 
 
3. How Does It Work? 
Step 1: Survey Design 
Customized feedback forms on the ZOHO platform capture relevant competencies and Key 
Responsibility Areas (KRAs). 
Step 2: Peer Selection 
• Reporting managers nominate a mix of peers to provide feedback. 
• Employees can also choose peers who have had associations of more than 45 days. 
• Peer Selection Link: Click here. 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 3: Self-Review 
Employees rate themselves on their KRAs. 
• Self-Review Form: Access here. 
• Guide to Self-Review: View guide. 
Step 4: Peer Review 
Employees provide feedback for peers they have been selected to review. 
• Peer-Review Section: Access here. 
• Guide to Peer Review: View guide. 
Step 5: Manager Review 
Managers review performance, learning, and growth of their reportees. 
• Appraisee View: Access here. 
• Guide to Manager Review: View guide. 
 
Step 6: Feedback Collection 
Raters complete feedback forms within a specified timeframe. Anonymity and 
confidentiality are maintained. 
Step 7: Results Compilation 
Feedback from all sources is compiled into a comprehensive report, accessible under the 
“My Review” section of the performance module on ZOHO. 
• Viewing Results: Access here. 
 
Step 8: Sharing Feedback & Discussion 
Managers discuss feedback with employees, focusing on strengths, areas of improvement, 
and developmental goals.
