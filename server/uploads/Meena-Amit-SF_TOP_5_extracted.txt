What Is Significance? 
People with strong Significance talents want others to see their worth. They want people to recognize, hear and value 
them. Particularly, they want others to know and appreciate them for their unique strengths. They want people to view 
their contributions as substantial, powerful and significant. Their intense yearning for others to recognize them motivates 
them away from the mediocre and toward the exceptional. 
Why Your Significance Is Unique 
These Strengths Insights are personalized based on your CliftonStrengths results.

Because of your strengths, you may present yourself as highly talented, knowledgeable, or skilled. Perhaps it 
is important to you that certain individuals recognize or value your expertise. You may appreciate people who 
listen thoughtfully to what you say. 
It’s very likely that you occasionally scrutinize yourself from the vantage point of an outsider looking in. 
Somewhat aware of your public persona — that is, the personality you present to the world — you may strive 
to appear confident and polished. This partially explains why you intentionally strive to be perceived as a 
talented, skilled, knowledgeable, trustworthy, and accomplished individual. 
Instinctively, you sometimes yearn to have someone listen to you. This partially explains why you are eager to 
introduce yourself to outsiders and newcomers. Perhaps you tell them about your background, 
accomplishments, grades, or progress toward certain goals. Leaving them with the impression you are a 
person of influence or importance might be the objective of this first encounter. 
Chances are good that you enjoy working hard with little rest as long as you can partner with individuals who 
share your strong work ethic. Having low performers in a group certainly tries your patience, especially when 
they are content to meet the minimum expectations. You feel that your drive to do more and better work 
annoys them.

EXECUTING 
2. Achiever
® 
What Is Achiever? 
Achievers have a constant need for attainment. They have an internal fire burning inside them. It pushes them to do and 
achieve more. People with strong Achiever talents feel as if every day starts at zero. By the end of the day, they must 
accomplish something meaningful to feel good about themselves. And “every day” means every single day: workdays, 
weekends, holidays and even vacations. If the day passes without some form of achievement, no matter how small, 
Achievers feel dissatisfied. After finishing a challenging project, they rarely seek with a reward of a rest or an easy 
assignment. While they appreciate recognition for past achievements, their motivation lies in striving toward the next 
goal on the horizon.

Instinctively, you periodically use your quick, skillful wit to lighten the serious mood of people who may feel 
frustrated, overwhelmed, angry, or disappointed. Perhaps your amusing stories or playful antics help them 
laugh when they want to cry. 
By nature, you may pride yourself on your capacity to accomplish a great deal. You might be happiest when 
you are continually busy. You might need to be occupied with tasks. Perhaps completing certain tasks 
exhilarates you. Why? To some extent, finishing one thing frees you to undertake additional work. 
Because of your strengths, you sometimes invest much physical or mental energy doing what you know you 
do well. Perhaps your selectivity is the key to your success. To some extent, your work ethic enables you to 
reach desirable goals. 
Chances are good that you periodically produce precise and thoroughly documented facts or data. Certain 
processes, issues, opportunities, proposals, historic records, questions, or solutions may occupy your 
thoughts for extended periods of time.

RELATIONSHIP BUILDING 
3. Relator
® 
What Is Relator? 
Relator talents describe a person’s attitude toward their relationships. People with strong Relator talents are drawn to 
others they already know. They do not necessarily shy away from meeting new people — in fact, they may have other 
themes that cause them to enjoy the thrill of turning strangers into friends — but they do derive a great deal of pleasure 
and strength from being around their close friends. A person with strong Relator talents forms close relationships with 
people.

It’s very likely that you may feel more optimistic about life when you surround yourself with truthful and 
upright people. Perhaps you keep your distance from deceitful and unethical individuals. 
Instinctively, you easily differentiate good times with others from favorite times with your closest friends. 
While you don’t mind interacting with people, memorable moments with your good friends are your fuel. 
Chances are good that you thrive in settings where you can accomplish things. Of course, you have your 
own step-by-step way of performing repetitious tasks. As long as you can stick to your preferred plan of 
action, you usually enjoy handling the details and deadlines related to jobs, chores, projects, hobbies, 
assignments, or errands. 
By nature, you are very fond of and devoted to the people in your life. You thrive when individuals reciprocate 
— that is, return — your feelings of warmth and affection. 
Driven by your talents, you might be comfortable conversing with individuals who know a few things they 
want to accomplish personally and/or professionally. Perhaps you can bond with certain people when they 
are open and honest about their goals. Typically you derive much satisfaction from helping others design 
performance objectives for themselves.

STRATEGIC THINKING 
4. Analytical
® 
What Is Analytical? 
People with strong Analytical talents challenge others to prove it. They take a critical approach to what others might 
quickly accept as truth. They search for the reasons why things are the way they are. They want to understand how 
certain patterns affect one another: how they combine, the outcome and if the result fits with the theory or the situation. 
Others see them as logical and rigorous. Some might feel that they are negative or unnecessarily critical when they are 
simply trying to understand something. They bring an objective and dispassionate examination to things enabling them 
to find the causes and effects, and then developing clear thoughts based on facts.

Instinctively, you may rely on credible facts or objective data when you are faced with a difficult choice. 
Perhaps you refuse to act in haste. Occasionally you might ask for more time to examine the evidence or 
evaluate the situation before deciding on a course of action. 
By nature, you might be unsentimental and realistic, especially when you must plan how to do something 
efficiently, reliably, or predictably time after time. Perhaps you streamline some of your daily, weekly, monthly, 
or annual chores. You may identify the steps needed to complete the task. You might study the 
requirements, overlooking no details. You might tend to concentrate on the basic facts. Maybe you avoid 
letting prejudice or favoritism cloud — that is, confuse — your judgment. 
Because of your strengths, you characteristically use reason to enlighten individuals about the intricacies of 
issues, processes, events, problems, or decisions. You often detect nuances in data and information that 
people generally overlook. You derive much pleasure from bringing key facts, points, and circumstances to 
the attention of others. 
It’s very likely that you customarily spend time with reasonable people. You appreciate their ability to rely on 
their minds rather than their emotions. When personal or professional problems, challenges, or opportunities 
arise, these individuals exhibit good judgment.

5. Competition
® 
What Is Competition? 
Competition is rooted in comparison. For people with strong Competition talents, their performance is their ultimate 
yardstick. When they look at the world, they are instinctively aware of other people’s performance. They aspire to be the 
best and will work hard to excel — especially when compared with others. It’s not about the effort; it’s about the win. 
Regardless of effort or intention, even if they reach their goal, their achievement will feel hollow if they did not outperform 
their peers. They need to compare. If they can compare, they can compete, and if they can compete, they can win.

It’s very likely that you may feel that life is good when you can outthink and outmaneuver your rivals, 
classmates, or peers. 
Instinctively, you periodically rely on your sophisticated vocabulary to outthink certain people. Whether 
speaking or writing, you might interject technical or subject-specific terms to confront resistance or force 
specific issues into the open. This authoritarian stance may put a few people on notice that you are clever. 
Sometimes their confidence begins to crumble. Perhaps your ease with language and artful tactics signal 
that you are the one in charge. 
Driven by your talents, you persevere in your efforts because you believe diligence is rewarded. Reaching 
your goals spurs you to toil with even greater purpose. 
By nature, you may aim to be “number one” or the very best at certain things. Sometimes you want to be the 
person who has a lot of followers. Laying claim to the top job in an organization might be one of your goals. 
You may feel that being a follower all of the time would be dissatisfying. 
Chances are good that you exhibit a deep-seated desire to succeed. You intentionally and unapologetically 
strive for promotions, fame, or financial gain by showcasing your natural or acquired abilities. You often 
perform special tasks with apparent ease.
