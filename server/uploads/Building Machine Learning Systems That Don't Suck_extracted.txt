Learn to Build Machine Learning Systems That
Don't Suck
A live, interactive program that'll show you how to design, build, and deploy production-ready
systems from scratch — without the fluff.
This program is for builders looking to solve real-world problems
using AI/ML.
Most Machine Learning courses are boring, too academic, and never talk about how
to ship actual products.
This program is different. This is a practical, no-nonsense, hands-on program that
will teach you the skills you need for building production systems in weeks, not
months.
You'll walk away from this program having designed, built, and deployed an end-to-
end Machine Learning system, plus a proven playbook for selling, planning, and
delivering world-class work backed by 30 years of real-world experience.
This is the class I wish I had taken when I started.

You'll enjoy lifetime access to every future cohort and a private community
where you can collaborate with thousands of students like you.
This program will completely change the way you think about Machine Learning.
You'll ditch the typical classroom fluff in favor of practical strategies that actually
work.
Day 1 - How To Start (Almost) Any Project
In this session, you'll learn how to pitch, sell, structure, and launch a new Machine
Learning project. You'll find out how to frame complex problems in ways that set
you up for successful solutions. Then, you'll cover how to run a discovery phase,
address selection bias, manage data collection and labeling, and build an initial
prototype.
Day 2 - How To Build A Model (That Works)
In this session, you'll explore data cleaning and feature engineering, and learn
how to preprocess data using vectorization, normalization, and imputation. Next,
you'll cover strategies for selecting the best model for your problem and discuss
how to iteratively build an end-to-end training pipeline. Finally, you'll walk through
distributed training so you can scale your models with data and model
parallelism.
Day 3 - How To Ensure Models Aren't Lying to Us
In this session, you'll explore different evaluation strategies, such as cross-
validation, LLM-as-a-judge, backtesting, invariance, and behavioral testing.
Next, you'll see how to frame evaluation metrics in the context of business goals,
ensuring your models work in real-world scenarios. Finally, you'll learn to prevent
data leakages, perform error analysis, and handle imbalanced data.
Day 4 - How To Serve Model Predictions (In A Clever Way)
23/04/2025, 15:56
Building Machine Learning Systems That Don't Suck
https://www.ml.school
3/9
In this session, you'll explore how to version and deploy models while dealing with
key trade-offs and operational considerations. Next, you'll examine different
strategies for serving predictions, including human-in-the-loop and cost-
sensitive workflows. Finally, you'll learn about pruning, quantization, knowledge
distillation, and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to compress and optimize models
for real-world applications.
Day 5 - How To Monitor A Model (Drift Is Awful)
In this session, you'll learn how to handle edge cases and outliers, address
feedback loops, and detect and understand distribution shifts like covariate shift,
label shift, and concept drift. Next, you'll see how to use adversarial validation
and explore practical strategies for monitoring models in production. Finally, you'll
explore different techniques to build resilient models that adapt to distribution
shifts.
Day 6 - How To Build Continual Learning Systems
In this session, you'll learn how to dynamically extend the capabilities of your
model using the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and how to automate the entire
process of building, deploying, and maintaining a model in production to create
systems that learn and improve over time. You'll explore incremental training
techniques, how to avoid catastrophic forgetting and different methods for
retraining your models. Finally, you'll see how to test models in production using
A/B testing, canary releases, shadow deployments, and interleaving
experiments.
Code walkthroughs
You'll get access to an end-to-end, production-ready template system for training,
evaluating, deploying, and monitoring machine learning models.
The codebase comes with extensive documentation to help you understand how
the code works and how you could change it to accommodate your needs.

While we'll discuss many fundamental ideas behind machine learning, beginners
will find the sessions go much faster than what's optimal for them.
What does "lifetime access" mean?
You only pay once to join the program and get immediate access to every past,
present, and future cohort.
Every new iteration of the program is better than the ones before. Many students
take classes once and then join a later cohort to benefit from the updates.
The lifetime access removes any pressure from having to complete the program
when life gets in the way.
Hey! I'm Santiago.
I'm the instructor of the program.
I'm a machine learning engineer with three decades of experience
building and scaling enterprise software and machine learning systems.
From 2009 to 2023, I had the privilege of building systems for
companies like Disney, Boston Dynamics, IBM, Dell, G4S, Anheuser-
Busch, HP, and NextEra Energy, among others. Across these projects, I
learned what it takes to build reliable and scalable software that works.
I started this program in March 2023, and since then, thousands of
students have successfully graduated.

will find the sessions go much faster than what's optimal for them.
What does "lifetime access" mean?
You only pay once to join the program and get immediate access to every past,
present, and future cohort.
Every new iteration of the program is better than the ones before. Many students
take classes once and then join a later cohort to benefit from the updates.
The lifetime access removes any pressure from having to complete the program
when life gets in the way.
Hey! I'm Santiago.
I'm the instructor of the program.
I'm a machine learning engineer with three decades of experience
building and scaling enterprise software and machine learning systems.
From 2009 to 2023, I had the privilege of building systems for
companies like Disney, Boston Dynamics, IBM, Dell, G4S, Anheuser-
Busch, HP, and NextEra Energy, among others. Across these projects, I
learned what it takes to build reliable and scalable software that works.
I started this program in March 2023, and since then, thousands of
students have successfully graduated.
